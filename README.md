🔍 Project Title: IPL Data Analysis using PANDAS 🛠 Tools Used: PANDAS,Matplotlib IPL Dataset (from Kaggle or similar)

📊 IPL Data Analysis using Python(Pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn) 

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) data using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset contained match details, player performances, and team statistics across multiple IPL seasons.

🔹 Key Steps in the Project:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, renamed columns, and structured the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Pandas functions to summarize data, calculate averages, maximums, and trends.

Player & Team Insights: Identified top run scorers, leading wicket-takers, win percentages, and toss-winning advantages.

Visualization: Represented insights using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs (with Matplotlib/Seaborn) for better understanding.

Key Findings: Discovered patterns in team performances, player consistency, and factors influencing match outcomes.

🔹 Skills Demonstrated:

Data manipulation with Pandas & NumPy

Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Extracting meaningful insights from raw datasets

Presenting cricket statistics in an analytical format
